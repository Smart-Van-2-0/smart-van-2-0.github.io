We have updated the **Bill of Materials (BOM)** for the **SVBox 1.0** model. The
main change involves the module used for controlling the camper's 12V services.
We have switched to a 10A relays module.

Additionally, we have made minor updates to some components, including ports
and various cables.

You can download the [BOM List 1.0.1](/img/hardware/svbox_10/resources/SVBox%20BOM%20List%201.0.1.pdf)
or find it in the [Resources](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/resources) section of the
[SV Box 1.0](/docs/hardware/svbox_10) model.
