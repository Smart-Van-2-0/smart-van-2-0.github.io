We are thrilled to announce the release of our latest model, the SVBox IoT 1.0.
This new model is a significant upgrade from our previous versions, focusing on
the Internet of Things (IoT) and the 'brain' of the Smart Van Box.

The **SVBox IoT 1.0 is designed for daily use within your vehicles**. It is a
compact, efficient, and powerful device that can seamlessly integrate with your
existing vehicle systems.

## Assembly and Configuration

We have made the assembly process as simple and intuitive as possible. The SVBox
IoT 1.0 uses HAT modules, which are designed to be stacked one on top of the other,
much like LEGO bricks. This design allows for easy assembly and disassembly,
providing flexibility and convenience.

In addition to the main HAT modules, there are three other boards (2x gas sensors
+ relays) that need to be connected via cables to the main block of the device,
which also houses the Raspberry Pi. Once you have received all the components,
you can proceed with the assembly.

## Specifications and Features

The SVBox IoT 1.0 comes with a host of features and specifications. It can provide
GNSS info from various systems (GPS/Beidou/GLONASS/GALILEO/QZSS), detect movement,
orientation, and the magnetic field, provide environment-related data, and much more.

With the AW9523B, the IO Expansion board can listen up to 16 buttons (8 by default)
and control up to 16 relays (8 by default). Victron's SmartSolar/BlueSolar series
devices can provide info about the service's battery status, solar panel charge,
and load consumption.

The UPS Pack with its own battery for the IoT block provides info about the
battery status. The SIM7600 module can provide mobile connectivity and its
status. You can use the onboard RPi WiFi to provide a local WiFi network and
keep track of the RPi load status.
