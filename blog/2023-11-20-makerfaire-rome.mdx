Exciting news from the Maker Faire Rome, where the Smart Van project made a
stellar appearance from November 20 to 22, 2023. Positioned in the vibrant
pavilion 4 Life, just to the left upon entering, our innovative project drew
attention and captivated the audience.

In pavilion 4 Life, alongside other groundbreaking projects like fruit-picking
robots and high-tech greenhouses, the Smart Van project showcased its brilliance.
The enthusiasm was palpable as visitors explored the diverse range of innovations.

Our booth featured an entire camperized van 🚐, complete with
the [prototype panel](/docs/hardware/panel_prototype) installed. The immersive
display transported visitors to a camping and windsurfing scene, showcasing the
practicality and versatility of the Smart Van Box.

The response exceeded our expectations, with a continuous stream of visitors
eager to learn about the Smart Van Box functionalities and the camperization
process. Questions ranged from technical aspects to the sheer curiosity about
transforming a regular van into a smart and functional mobile hub.

🏆 Maker of Merit Award: To our delight, the Smart Van project was honored with
the prestigious Maker of Merit award. This accolade is reserved for a select
few projects deemed the most intriguing and with significant potential for success.

A heartfelt thank you to the entire Smart Van team, who tirelessly answered
questions with passion and wore brilliant smiles throughout the three-day event.
Your dedication and enthusiasm truly made the Smart Van project shine.
