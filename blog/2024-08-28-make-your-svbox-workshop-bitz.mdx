Yesterday, we held our first SmartVanBox workshop at the BITZ Fab Lab in Bolzano.
Our inaugural participants, Jonas and Hannelore, **successfully created their own
SmartVanBox** devices during the session.

The workshop began with a brief presentation of the SmartVanBox project, followed
by a technical introduction to how it works. Once the overview was complete, we
quickly got to work on assembling the SmartVanBox units.

Thanks to the 3D printers at the BITZ Fab Lab, we had pre-prepared the cases,
which allowed us to **complete the assembly and configuration in just a couple of
hours**. While setting up, we encountered a few issues with the WiFi connection,
but we eventually managed to install the JOD SmartVan distribution on the
SmartVanBox devices. Once that was done, we tested the work done connecting to the
SmartVanBox using a smartphone and the SV Mobile App.

At the end of the workshop, Roberto, our lead developer, demonstrated the various
possibilities these devices offer. Besides their obvious use in campers, the Open
Source nature of SmartVanBox makes them incredibly easy to modify and update,
allowing users to adapt them to whatever needs they might have on the road.

**Weâ€™re planning another workshop soon** â€” stay tuned and donâ€™t miss the chance to sign up!
