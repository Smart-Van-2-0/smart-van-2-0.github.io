### Who?

Hi! I'm [Roberto](https://github.com/robypomper), and I'm an IoT Architect, but
also a windsurfer, snowboarder and I love traveling and being outdoors.<br/>

### Why?

Some time ago, I decided to combine my passions and start this project.<br/>
My starting points? An already converted Scudo van (it was my first experience,
therefore only positive criticisms are accepted); a platform for creating
connected objects, the result of another project of mine: John O.S. Project.

From here the step was almost mandatory. So here are the first box prototypes
for SmartVan. They are based on my needs and therefore on the devices I have
already installed inside my van (solar charger, lights, water pump...). To make
everything more useful, I also decided to include the reasons for my choices
and all the technical specifications in the documentation. In this way, **even
the less experienced will be able to follow the tutorials and create his own
Smart Van**, and re-share his experience.

But, given that: "each camper is as unique as its owner", I need the help of
the community to make this project more accessible. Go to the <MapCollaborate />
page and start sharing your experience, how did you setup your van/camper or
suggest some improvement.

### What?

The purpose of this project, and of this site, is to **collect and organize the
know-how necessary to customize vans and campers**. Advising the right
practices and tools to create even electrical or plumbing systems in complete
safety.

In particular, with this project **we want to focus on the connected object
principle**, therefore making the control and management of our vehicle smart.
With this, we mean being able to check the status of resources (e.g. energy,
water...) and control the services comfortably from a SmartPhone.<br />

Contrary to many other solutions available, the SmartVan project can be adapted
to any situation. On the one hand, everyone is free to choose what to "connect"
batteries, water tanks, lights, sensors... On the other hand, the application
recognizes your setup and only shows the relevant sections.

The know more on the SmartVan project, how it works and how to get it, please
visit the <MapDocs /> page.

### The SV WebSite

The goal for this website is to act as a point of reference for documenting
and exchanging everyone's experiences on customizing campers and vans.<br />
It doesn't matter if you are a novice or a super experienced camper. If you are
looking for how to modify your vehicle and make it Smart. So, come on, start
studying the documentation for or negotiating the features of SmartVan to come
up with your next idea. But don't forget to share your experience on SmartVan's
<LinkFacebookPage  label="socials" />.

At the same time, the development of the project will also be directed according
to the preferences and needs of the community.
