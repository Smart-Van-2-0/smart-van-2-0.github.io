The [SmartVanBox IoT 1.0](/docs/hardware/svbox_10) is now available, along with
comprehensive open-source documentation to help you build your own SVBox.

**What is the SVBox?**<br/>
The SVBox is a powerful IoT device, an essential accessory for any camper, van,
or caravan. It serves as a smart control unit that assists travelers in
maintaining their vehicles and enjoying every journey to the fullest.

**How Does it Work?**<br/>
The SmartVanBox is one of the three components that make up the SmartVan solution.
Along with the [SmartVan Mobile App](/docs/software/sv_mobile_app/android) and
the accompanying cloud service, these three components work together to provide
the user with a seamless digital travel experience.

**What's inside?**<br/>
The SVBox is installed inside your vehicle and powered by a 12V supply, similar
to other camper services like lights and fans. It houses various sensors, as
well as LTE and GNSS modules to ensure constant connectivity. Additionally, the
SVBox is designed to integrate seamlessly with other devices in your camper,
such as the SolarCharger. For a full list of components, refer to the
[SVBox's Specification](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/specs) page.

**What Can I Do With It?**<br/>
The SVBox is used in conjunction with its mobile app, providing a user-friendly
interface to view and export collected data (e.g., energy monitoring, tank levels).
The app also acts as a command and control center, allowing users to easily
customize the intelligence of their SmartVanBox to meet their specific needs.
More examples can be found into the <MapFeatures/> page.

## Build It?

Creating an IoT device from scratch can be challenging, but don't be discouraged!
Our guides will walk you through each step of the process. To help you stay
organized, we've divided the guide into six sections: from ordering the necessary
materials to configuring the software, including 3D printing the case and
assembling the hardware components.

If you lack certain tools, such as a 3D printer, find the [nearest FabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/labs).
There, you'll have access to the right tools and people who can assist you with
the more complex steps.

Our documentation includes all the original files, so if you decide to customize
your SmartVanBox, you can start with the models we've already created. Just
remember to share your results with the community!

Don't wait any longerâ€”open the [BOM](/img/hardware/svbox_10/resources/SVBox%20BOM%20List%201.0.1.pdf)
and start ordering the necessary components today.

1. [Order Materials](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/resources)<br/>
  Refer to the Bill of Materials (BOM) for the necessary components.
2. [Print the Case](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides/print_smartvanbox_case)<br/>
  Download and print the 3D models specifically designed to house the ordered hardware.
3. [Configure the SD Card](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides/prepare_sdcard)<br/>
   While printing the case, prepare the SD card that will be used with the Raspberry Pi.
4. [Assemble the SVBox](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides/assembly_smartvanbox)<br/>
   Once you have the printed case and received components, assemble the SmartVanBox.
5. [Install Software](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van/guides/install_jod_sv_dist_remote_device)<br/>
   Finally, install the required software, including the JOD SmartVan Distribution daemon.
