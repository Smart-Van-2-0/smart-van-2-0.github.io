Hi! Thank you for clicking on this section.

### Social and Sharing

The simplest and fastest help you can give to the project and **give it
visibility on social networks**, by following the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100095337571720">Facebook page</a>
and sharing its contents.

### Report a problem or Propose an idea

Actually the SmartVan project is very big and a lot of help is needed.<br />
This is not a project related only to information technology or electronics.
First of all, it is a project to simplify the life of those who love camping
with their own vehicle. And therefore, it requires many soft skills.

For this reason **everyone is free to recommend new features or solve problems**
and finally re-share with the community.

The starting point for reporting a change or suggestion is the page <a href="https://github.com/Smart-Van-2-0/collaborate/issues">SmartVan 2.0/Collaborate/New Issue</a>.
On this page it is possible to open a new issue visible to the whole community.
Before opening a duplicated issue, please use the `filter` field at the <a href="https://github.com/Smart-Van-2-0/collaborate/issues/new">SmartVan 2.0/Collaborate/Issues</a>
page.

In order to facilitate the work of reviewing the issues, a labels category has
been defined so as to catalog the type of suggestion. The types available are
as follows:
* MobileApp / Feature
* MobileApp / Bug
* Hardware Generic / Feature
* Hardware PanelPrototype / Bug
* Hardware BoxPrototype / Bug
* Hardware New Model

As you can guess from the categories, you can contribute with simple things
(bug reports or ideas) up to even proposing your own prototypes and features.<br />
So don't wait, start growing the SmartVan project!
