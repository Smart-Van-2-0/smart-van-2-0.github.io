Transform your camper into a smart, automated space with the Automations feature
of the [SmartVan Mobile App](/docs/software/sv_mobile_app/android). This powerful
tool allows you to automate various functions using custom IFTTT (If This, Then
That) logic and alerts, making your travel experience more convenient and
enjoyable. You can create automation rules to control lights, ventilation,
heating, and much more—all with just a tap on your mobile device.

* **Custom IFTTT Logic:** Set specific conditions to trigger actions
  automatically. For example, turn on the fan if the internal temperature
  exceeds 28°C, or receive an alert if a door is left open.
* **Physical Buttons for Easy Scenes:** The SmartVanBox includes physical buttons
  that you can program to create personalized scenes. Imagine stepping out at
  sunset and, with a single press, turning on the exterior lights and extending
  the awning to prepare your outdoor space.
* **Community-Driven Solutions:** Browse the automations shared by the Smart Van
  community to discover new ways to enhance your setup. You can easily import
  these shared automations to quickly add new functions to your system.

## Practical Use Cases

**Climate Control Made Easy:** Keep your camper comfortable without manual
  intervention by setting an automation to activate the ventilation system when
  the interior temperature rises above a specified threshold. This keeps the air
  cool and fresh without you having to lift a finger.
**Create Your Ideal Scenes:** Use the physical buttons on the SmartVanBox to set
  up different scenes, such as a "Relax Mode" that turns on soft lighting and
  adjusts the heating for a cozy atmosphere when you're settling in for the night.


With Automations, turning your camper into a smart space is just a few taps away.
Personalize your experience, enhance convenience, and enjoy peace of mind knowing
that your camper is working for you, automatically.
