When traveling in a campervan, it is important to plan your route carefully to
optimize your resources. This means planning stops for loading and unloading
water and waste, as well as for charging batteries.

Smart Van can help you plan your stops efficiently. The app allows you to search
for disposal areas, supermarkets with charging stations, and distributors with
taps for water tanks along your route.

Here are some tips for optimizing your resources during campervan trips:

* Stop at disposal areas along the way. This will save you from having to
  search for a disposal area when you arrive at your destination.
* Prefer supermarkets with charging stations. This will allow you to charge
  your batteries while shopping.
* Fill up with water at distributors with taps for water tanks. This will
  allow you to always have fresh water on hand.

Follow these tips and you will save time and money on your campervan trips. You
will be able to focus on your favorite activities once you arrive at your destination.
