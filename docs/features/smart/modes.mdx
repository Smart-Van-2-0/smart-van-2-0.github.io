SmartVan offers a range of automations that can be used to improve the comfort,
safety, and travel experience of campervan owners. The automations can be
customized based on three operative modes: driving, parked, and camper.

Those Smart Van modes can be activated based on a number of criteria, such as:

* Vehicle speed
* Vehicle location
* Presence of people inside the vehicle

### Moving mode

In this mode, SmartVan is able to determine if the vehicle is in motion based
on speed and acceleration.

* Securing the camper: SmartVan can automatically close the gas and water tank
  solenoid valves to prevent leaks.
* Collection of travel data: SmartVan can collect travel data such as speed,
  location, and fuel consumption.

### Parked mode

In this mode, SmartVan is able to determine if the vehicle is parked based on
speed and acceleration.

* Activation of security features: SmartVan can automatically activate security
  features such as the anti-theft system and automatic door closing.
* Collection of environmental data: SmartVan can collect environmental data
  such as temperature and humidity.

### Camper mode

In this mode, SmartVan is able to determine if the vehicle is being used as a
camper based on the vehicle's location and the presence of people inside.

* Activation of comfort features: SmartVan can automatically activate comfort
  features such as heating or air conditioning and interior lighting.
* Collection of usage data: SmartVan can collect usage data such as the time 
  spent in camper mode and the features used.
