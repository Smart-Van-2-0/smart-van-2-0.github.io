Parking is one of the most stressful activities of everyday life. Finding a
free spot, paying the fare, and above all not risking getting a ticket can
be a challenge.

SmartVan's "Where is my car" feature helps you find your car easily and quickly.
You can activate it when you park and the app will show you the exact location
of your car on the map.

SmartVan is also integrated with the main parking services, such as ParkingGo
and MyCicero. Thanks to these integrations, you can pay for parking and receive
notifications when the parking time is about to expire.

The advantages of smart parking

Smart parking offers numerous advantages, including:

* Ease of use: Finding your car and paying for parking has become easier than ever.
* Efficiency: Notifications notify you when the parking time is about to expire, preventing you from receiving tickets.
* Security: The "Where is my car" feature helps you find your car even in a crowded parking lot.
Conclusion

In addition to the features mentioned above, SmartVan also offers an anti-theft
feature thanks to the GNSS module. This module allows you to track your car in
real time and receive alerts if it is moved without your permission. More info
