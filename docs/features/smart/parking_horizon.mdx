Finding the perfect spot to park your campervan and then leveling it perfectly
can be a source of heated debate. But it doesn't have to be. SmartVan can help
you find the perfect tilt to park your campervan in perfect balance, so you
can sleep soundly without rolling from side to side.

SmartVan uses sensors like a gyroscope and accelerometer to measure the tilt of
your campervan. It then displays this information in real time in a 3D GUI. This
way, you can see at any time whether your campervan is perfectly level or if
changes need to be made.

SmartVan is perfect for campervan owners who want to sleep well at night. It can
also be useful for campervan owners who want to cook or do other activities in
their campervan without worrying about uneven surfaces.
