Smart-heatmaps are a new way to see maps. Using location data and other data,
smart-heatmaps can create maps that show the distribution of things like
internet signal quality, solar charging capacity, points of interest, and
travel statistics.

Smart-heatmaps can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

* Discovering new places: Smart-heatmaps can be used to identify areas with a
  high concentration of points of interest or with good network coverage. This
  can help travelers to discover new places to visit or to find a place to
  connect to the internet.
* Moving like a local: Smart-heatmaps can be used to identify popular areas or
  busy streets. This can help travelers to move like a local and avoid crowded
  areas.
* Planning trips: Smart-heatmaps can be used to identify areas with good
  network coverage or with a high concentration of points of interest. This
  can help travelers to plan their trips more efficiently.
