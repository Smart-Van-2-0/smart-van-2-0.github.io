Forget the hassle of last-minute packing and unexpected surprises with Smart
Checklists, your ultimate travel companion for the road. The [SmartVan Mobile App](/docs/software/sv_mobile_app/android)
helps you stay organized before, during, and after your trip, ensuring nothing
is left behind. Choose from pre-made checklists, customize them to fit your
needs, or create entirely new ones from scratch.

* **Predefined or Customizable Lists:** Access ready-made checklists tailored for
  different aspects of your journey. From basic tasks like "buy bread" or "call Mom"
  to camper-specific duties such as "charge batteries" or "empty waste tanks"
  you’ll find it all covered.
* **Sensor-Integrated Task Management:** Certain tasks can be automatically
  tracked with the help of the integrated sensors in the SmartVanBox. For example,
  if the battery charge exceeds the set level, then the relative task is solved
  automatically.
* **Automatic Reminders:** The app alerts you if there are any tasks you haven't
  completed, keeping your trip preparation and on-the-go management stress-free.

## Practical Use Cases

**Pre-Trip Preparation:** Create your own personalized checklist to ensure you
have everything you need, from essential camping gear to groceries. The app will
automatically verify that critical items, like camping chairs or provisions, are
checked off before you set off.

**On-the-Road Management:** Use specialized checklists to track important tasks
throughout the journey, such as monitoring battery levels or emptying tanks.
You'll receive automatic notifications when it's time to take action, keeping
everything running smoothly.


With Smart Checklists, you can enjoy a worry-free journey knowing that the app is
keeping track of all your important tasks. No more forgotten items or overlooked
maintenance—just smooth and organized travels every time.
