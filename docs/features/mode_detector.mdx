The Mode Detector feature automatically adapts your app experience based on the
current status of your camper, ensuring you always have access to the right
features at the right time. By utilizing sensors installed in the Smart Van Box
and advanced machine learning algorithms, the Mode Detector can accurately
determine whether your vehicle is in Driving, Parking, or Camping mode.

* **Driving Mode:** When the vehicle is in motion, the app switches to a
  driving-friendly interface, prioritizing features like navigation, road
  planning, and real-time vehicle monitoring.
* **Parking Mode:** Once parked, the app provides tools for parking assistance,
  reminders for parking tickets, and access to security features.
* **Camping Mode:** When you’ve settled at a campsite, the app transitions to
  camping mode, offering features related to resource management, automation,
  and comfort controls, such as lighting and climate settings.

As the mode changes, the app’s interface automatically updates to present the
most relevant functionalities, keeping your travel experience seamless and
user-friendly.
