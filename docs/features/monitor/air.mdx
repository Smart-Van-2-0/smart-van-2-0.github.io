Air monitoring is an important safety feature provided by the Smart Van. It can
help protect passengers from harmful gases and air pollution.

Gas and PM sensors continuously monitor the air quality inside and outside the
vehicle. If a dangerous concentration of gas or PM is detected, the air
monitoring system will sound an alarm and may take measures to protect
passengers, such as turning off devices that use gas or fuel, disabling solenoid
valves, or opening windows and doors to ventilate the interior of the vehicle.

In addition, the air monitoring system can provide information on air pollution
levels in the surrounding area. This information can be useful for campers who
want to find less polluted areas to park.

Here are some of the benefits of air monitoring in campervans:

* Improved safety: Air monitoring can help protect passengers from harmful gases
  and air pollution.
* Improved comfort: Air monitoring can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh
  and clean.
* Improved health: Air monitoring can help reduce exposure to pollutants that
  can harm health.
