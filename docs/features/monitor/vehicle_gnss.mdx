SmartVan is a system that helps campervan owners track their trips, discover
new destinations, and stay safe.

SmartVan uses a GNSS module to track the campervan's location in real time. This
information can be used to view statistics about the trip, such as distance
traveled, time spent driving, and costs incurred. SmartVan also stores the
campervan's location history, so users can easily find where they parked their
vehicle.

SmartVan uses a variety of factors to suggest new destinations to users, such
as their interests, budget, and previous trips. Users can also provide feedback
to help SmartVan improve its suggestions.

SmartVan's GNSS module can also be used as an anti-theft device. If the
campervan is stolen, SmartVan will send the owner the vehicle's location. This
information can be used by law enforcement to recover the vehicle.
