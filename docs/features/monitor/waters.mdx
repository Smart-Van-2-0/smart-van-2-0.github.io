With SmartVan Box, you can keep track of the status of your water tanks in real
time, configure them as fresh, gray, or black water, and automate refilling and
emptying tasks.

SmartVan Box will alert you when the water level is low or when it's time to
refill or empty your tanks. This way, you can forget about your water tanks and
focus on your trip.

Here are some examples of how SmartVan Box can help you:

* If you're in a remote area with no water, SmartVan Box will remind you when
  your tanks are low and help you find a place to refill them.
* If you're planning a long campervan road trip, SmartVan Box can help you
  calculate your water usage and ensure you have enough water for the trip.
* If you're camping with a large group, SmartVan Box can help you track water
  usage and ensure everyone has enough water.
* With SmartVan Box, managing the water in your campervan is easy and quick.
