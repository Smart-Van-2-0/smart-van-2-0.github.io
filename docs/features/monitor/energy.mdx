SmartVan Box allows you to monitor the entire energy flow of your camper, from
generation through solar panels to consumption by the services. In this way,
you can optimize your camper's range without changing your habits.

In addition to real-time data and its history, you can view points on the map
where the solar panels have charged the service battery the best, or where it
is possible to connect to an electric column.

This feature allows you to plan your trips and ensure that you always have
enough energy to meet your needs:

* If you are about to stop in an area with little sunlight, you can reduce your
  energy consumption to conserve the service battery.
* If you are about to arrive in an area with many electric columns, you can
  schedule service battery charging to save time.
* If you are planning a long trip, you can calculate the energy consumption
  required to ensure that you have enough energy to reach your destination.
