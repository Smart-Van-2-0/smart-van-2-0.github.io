Remote work is becoming increasingly popular, but it can be difficult to maintain
a reliable internet connection when you're working in mobility. SmartVan can help
you improve your remote office internet by providing you with a heatmap of the
quality of internet in your area.

SmartVan uses a variety of sensors to monitor the signal strength and speed of
internet connections in your area. This information is then used to create a
heatmap that shows you where the best internet is located.

With SmartVan, you can always know where to go when you need a strong internet
connection for a call or to upload your work.
