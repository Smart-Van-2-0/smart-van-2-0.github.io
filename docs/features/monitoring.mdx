With the [SmartVan Mobile App](/docs/software/sv_mobile_app/android), monitoring
your camper's status has never been easier. The Monitoring feature gives you an
instant overview of your vehicle's health with a user-friendly interface that
uses a color-coded system to indicate its general status:

<img className={style_feature.head_img}
  src="/img/features/logos/features_monitoring_512.png"
  alt="Monitoring"
  width="70%"/>

* Green: Everything is in top shape—you're ready to hit the road without worries.
* Yellow: Some maintenance tasks need to be scheduled soon. It’s not urgent, but
  better to stay ahead.
* Red: Immediate attention is required for one or more components, making
  repairs a priority before your next journey.

The app's General Status function provides a comprehensive overview that goes
beyond just a simple warning. If the indicator shows anything other than green,
you can easily tap through to see detailed insights into the specific system
that needs attention. For example, check out the screenshots below to see how
you can quickly identify the issue and get real-time updates on key metrics,
such as battery levels, water tank levels, or even engine status.

If repairs or maintenance are needed, the app doesn't leave you stranded. It
suggests optimal pit stops that can be added to your [Route Planner](road_planner),
ensuring that you're never far from the help you need. This **proactive approach**
not only **saves time** but also adds an **extra layer of safety** to your travels.


Below are screenshots of the mobile app showcasing the Monitoring feature in
action. These visual guides help you understand exactly how to navigate through
the app to get the most from its functionalities:

## Practical Use Cases

**Quick Pre-Trip Check:** Before embarking on a new adventure, open the app and
take a quick glance at the General Status screen. If everything is green, you're
good to go. If not, use the detailed insights to address any potential issues
before they become bigger problems.

**On-the-Road Problem Solving:** If the app signals a yellow or red alert during
your trip, navigate to the relevant section with a few taps to understand what's
wrong. The detailed information enables you to make quick, informed
decisions—whether it means making a minor adjustment or arranging a stop for a
more extensive repair.


With the Smart Van Box, staying ahead of maintenance and avoiding unexpected
breakdowns has never been easier. Monitor your camper's health effortlessly and
enjoy your travels with complete peace of mind.
