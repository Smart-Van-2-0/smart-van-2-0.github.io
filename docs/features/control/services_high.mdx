Smart Van Box can also connect appliances that require more amps. You can
control these appliances remotely from your smartphone or tablet using the
Smart Van app. You can also add them to automations that will turn them on or
off automatically based on certain conditions.

For each output of the Smart Van Box, you can assign a device type. This will
enable specific features for that type of device. For example, for a
refrigerator, the power on/off buttons will be hidden and you will be able to
create automations based on the battery level or the refrigerator's operating mode.
