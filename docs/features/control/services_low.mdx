# Feature - Low-Power Services control

Connect and control your camper's low-consumption services. Lights, fans, and
water pumps are all small devices (12V and < 10A) that can be connected to the
Smart Van box. Once connected, you can control them remotely from your smartphone
or tablet using the Smart Van app. You can also add them to automations that
will turn them on or off automatically based on certain conditions, such as
time of day, temperature, or battery level. More details on the automations on
the [relevant pages](/docs/features/control).
