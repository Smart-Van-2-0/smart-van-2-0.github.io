Smart Van includes a convenient keypad that allows you to control your camper's
services without having to use your smartphone or tablet. The keypad is freely
configurable, so you can customize it to fit your needs.

For example, you can use a button to turn on the lights, another button to open
the awning, and another button to start the heating system. You can also use the
keypad to create custom scenes, such as a "bedtime" scene that turns off all the
lights and locks the doors.
