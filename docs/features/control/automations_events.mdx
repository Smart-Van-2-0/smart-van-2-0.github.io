SmartVan Box allows users to create automations based on events generated by
the camper's services and other functions. For example, you can set an
automation to close the gas solenoid valve when the van changes mode from
PARKED to DRIVING (see feature [Smart Mode Detector](/docs/features/smart/modes)).
For more details on available events, consult the Smart Van <MapFeatures />
list.
