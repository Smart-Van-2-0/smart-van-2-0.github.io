Information about energy consumption. Details are provided for both the <b>
overall consumption and the consumption of individual services</b>. In this case,
when the consumption of the individual service is not known, then it can be
estimated.

</SpecificationHeader>

The Smart Van Box provides detailed information about the energy consumption of
your camper or van. You can get the overall consumption, as well as the
consumption of individual services.

If the consumption of an individual service is not known, then it can be
estimated. The Smart Box provides a tool that can help you to do this.

<!--
Notes:

To estimate the consumption of an individual service, you will need to know the
following information:

The wattage of the device or appliance. This information can usually be found on
the label of the device or appliance.
The number of hours that the device or appliance is used each day.
Once you have this information, you can use the following formula to estimate
the consumption:

Consumption (kWh) = Wattage * Hours / 1000
For example, if a device has a wattage of 100 watts and is used for 6 hours each
day, then the estimated consumption is:

Consumption (kWh) = 100 * 6 / 1000 = 0.6 kWh
