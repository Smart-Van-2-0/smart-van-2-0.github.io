In this group, <b>all actuators present in the living area</b> of the camper are
collected. These specifications allow controlling relays and dimmers but also
estimating the power consumed.

</SpecificationHeader>

The specifications of actuators include information on their load capacity and
activation time. In addition, actuators differ in their ability to handle
different power ranges (high and low). High-power actuators are used to control
systems that require a large amount of energy, such as heating and ventilation.
Low-power actuators are used to control systems that require less energy, such
as lighting.

The pillars `* Low Max Current` specifies the average current that an actuators
type can safely handle.
