**Panel Prototype is the first Smart Van Box's version**, used to implement the
[JOD Smart Van Distribution](/docs/software/firmware/jod_smart_van).<br/>
This prototype is designed to be easily moved IN and OUT the van, but also to
be easily accessed to updated or change devices and wires.

This panel includes the devices for all three Boxes.<br/>
The **Power Box** is based on the SmartSolar charger from Victron and includes also
an inverter, a power charger (from 220V) and a DC/DC charger to the vehicle battery.<br/>
Into the **Integration Box** we can find all fuses for the camper's services but also
the relays module used to control those services.<br/>
Finally, the **IoT Box** is based on a Raspberry Pi plus: a SIM7600H-E, a Sense hat (c),
a UPS PowerPack, an 8 buttons box and other sensors.
