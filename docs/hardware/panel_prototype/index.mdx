This is **the first prototype of the Smart Van project**, used for the
development of the [JOD Smart Van](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van).
This panel is designed to provide convenient access to integrated devices,
facilitating development and testing. However, **this prototype can be easily
adapted to another form and used as a control unit for your camper**.

Currently, this panel includes all devices for electrical management with
charging from solar panels and a 200V power column. It provides mobile internet
connectivity through the 4G module, environmental monitoring with sensors, and
the ability to connect 8 camper services with as many physical buttons.<br/>
Furthermore, this prototype is equipped with a GNSS module and a buffer battery
for IoT components. This way, your van will stay connected even when the vehicle
batteries are completely discharged or not plugged.

## Build your Smart Van Box

Explore the documentation of this prototype to get an idea of how to adapt it to
your needs. We recommend looking at the list of [required materials](/docs/hardware/panel_prototype/resources#hardware-requirements)
and [case 3D models](/docs/hardware/panel_prototype/resources#cases) to
understand which devices need to be included in this prototype and where you can
position them.

1. <h3>Prepare all the necessary materials</h3>

  Check the [Hardware Requirements](/docs/hardware/panel_prototype/resources#hardware-requirements)
  and ensure you have everything needed to start. Note that many devices can be
  replaced with equivalent ones. More information can be found in
  the [Software/Firmwares](/docs/software#other-sources-and-repositories) pages
  related to the devices to be replaced.

2. <h3>Assemble the Smart Van Box's blocks and connect them</h3>

  Build each block following the [assembly guides](/docs/hardware/panel_prototype/guides#assembly).
  After that, position them on the panel and connect them together. If you
  prefer, you are free to change the arrangement and adapt it to the shape of
  your van.

3. <h3>Load the JOD Smart Van image and power everything on</h3>

  Flash the [JOD Smart Van](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van) image
  onto the SD card to be inserted into the IoT block's Raspberry Pi. After that,
  insert it into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.


## Panel's blocks

The devices in this prototype are streamlined into **three distinct blocks** for
ease of understanding: Power, Integration, and IoT.

The **IoT block** serves as the brain and, leveraging its Raspberry Pi, can
seamlessly expose the capabilities of the Smart Van Box to the SV Mobile App.
Additionally, this block houses a variety of environmental sensors and GPS and
GNSS modules.

In the remaining two blocks, you'll find the **Power** electronics, featuring a
solar charger, inverter, fuses, etc., alongside the **Integration** section for
camper services, encompassing relays, dimmers, and buttons.

### Power Block

The Power Block houses all devices for managing electrical energy, including the
Solar Charger, inverter, as well as fuses and switches for system and user
protection. Check out the BOM for a full list of the devices.

* [Main Panel shape and sizes](/img/hardware/panel_prototype/resources/Design%20Panel%20Prototype-Main%20Panel%20Schema.png)

### Integration Block

Within the Integration block, you'll find the actuators and their respective fuses
to control various camper services, moreover, the block houses some physical
buttons.

Remember to connect the services according to their power requirements. Each
12V output of the Integration Box has a maximum capacity, so ensure that the
connected service requires lower power.

### IoT Box

The IoT block serves as the brain of the Smart Van Box. It's an IoT device based
on Raspberry Pi that, with [JOD Smart Van](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van),
enables monitoring and controlling all devices connected to the Raspberry Pi
and, consequently, the Smart Van Box.

Within this block, various sensors are integrated, such as environmental
sensors, gas detection sensors, but also GPS and GSM modules. Additionally, the
block houses a buffer battery (UPS) that provides power to the IoT component
even when the service battery is disconnected or depleted.

The IoT block use a ribbon cable to connect the Raspberry Pi to all devices
with a 40-PIN header like the [Sense Hat](/docs/software/firmware/fw_sensehat),
the [SIM7600](/docs/software/firmware/fw_sim7600) and also a small custom
PCB board. This custom board houses the ports to connect the other devices in
the IoT block to the ribbon cable and thus to the Raspberry Pi.
