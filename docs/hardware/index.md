# Smart Van's Hardware

The first piece to compose a SmartVan is the hardware. Understood as **the set
of devices to be installed in the van** and connected to pre-existing devices
(such as batteries, solar panels, services).

Given that every camper is modeled on its owner, the hardware provided by the
SmartVan project must also be modelable and adaptable to different needs.

**This section is organized into models**, therefore within each model's pages you
will find all **the information necessary for assembling and connecting the
devices required for your SmartVan.**<br/>
In any case, the requirements commons to all models allow you to connect at least:
a service battery, an engine battery, solar panels and various camper services.

**NB:** *This is a draft list of the Smart Van hardware. Please see
