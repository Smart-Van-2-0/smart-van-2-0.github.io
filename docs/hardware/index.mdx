The first part of composing a SmartVan is the hardware. This is defined as the
**set of devices to be installed in the van** and connected to pre-existing
devices (such as batteries, solar panels and other services).

Since every camper is modeled on its owner, the hardware provided by the
SmartVan project must also be modular and customizable to meet different needs.
In this regard, the Smart Van project leverages the abstraction capabilities of
the [John OS Platform](https://www.johnosplatform.org). This IoT platform
segregates objects, the [Smart Van Box](#smart-van-boxes), and
services, the [SV Mobile App](/docs/software#sv-mobile-app), into two
distinct entities. The object provides a set of states and actions to the
service. This organizational structure is also reflected in the Smart Van
project <MapSpecs />:

:::note SV Box vs. SV Mobile App

Each Smart Van Box offers a series of states and actions (the SV specifications),
while the SV Mobile App utilizes them to implement its own functionalities.

:::

A Smart Van Box becomes a connected object the moment
the [JOD Smart Van](/docs/software#jod-smart-van) daemon is installed and
executed, serving as the object agent for the John OS Platform. This daemon is
responsible for **loading all the necessary firmwares and exposing
states/actions** to the SV Mobile App.

## Smart Van Boxes

This section is organized into model pages. Within each model's page, you will
find **all the information necessary to assemble and connect** the devices you
need for your SmartVan.<br/>
Once you've identified the Smart Van Box model that best suits your needs, you
can start building and customizing it to fit your camper.
