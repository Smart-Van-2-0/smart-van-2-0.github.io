This model of the Smart Van Box is designed **to be used daily within your own
vehicles**.

This model can provide mobile internet connectivity through the 4G module
environmental monitoring with sensors, and the ability to connect up to 4 camper's
services with as many physical buttons.

Furthermore, this prototype is equipped with a GNSS module and a buffer battery
for IoT components. This way, your van will stay connected even when the vehicle
batteries are completely discharged or not plugged.

## Build your Smart Van Box

Explore the documentation of this prototype to get an idea of how to adapt it to
your needs.

1. <h3>Prepare all the necessary materials</h3>
  Check the BOM lists from the [Hardware Requirements](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/resources#hardware-requirements)
  section and ensure you have everything needed to start.

2. <h3>Assemble your own Smart Van Box</h3>
  Let's start [printing the 3D model](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides/print_smartvanbox_case)
  for the SmartVanBox's case and [configure the SD Card](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides/prepare_sdcard)
  for the Raspberry Pi. Then, when you received the ordered components and the
  case has been printed, build your SmartVanBox following the [assembly guides](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides/assembly_smartvanbox).
  Finally [install the JOD SmartVan Distribution](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van/guides/install_jod_sv_dist_remote_device).

3. <h3>Mount the SmartVanBox on board and let's start with the SmartVan Mobile App</h3>
  Follow the [mounting guides](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides/mount_smartvanbox)
  for your SmartVanBox, then let's [download and install the SmartVan Mobile App](/docs/software/sv_mobile_app/android/guides/get_and_install_the_smartvan_mobile_app)
  on your phone. And **enjoy your SmartVan experience!**


## Model's resources

The SVBox IoT's an IoT device based on Raspberry Pi that, with [JOD Smart Van](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van),
enables monitoring and controlling all services/systems connected to the Raspberry Pi
and, consequently, the Smart Van Box.

Within this device, various sensors are integrated, such as environmental
sensors, gas detection sensors, but also GPS and GSM modules. Additionally, the
block houses a buffer battery (UPS) that provides power to the IoT component
even when the service battery is disconnected or depleted.

Internally, the SmartVanBox contains a Raspberry Pi 4 within a stack of HAT (in
order: [UPS Pack](/docs/software/firmware/fw_upspack_v3), Raspberry Pi,
[SIM7600](/docs/software/firmware/fw_sim7600) and [Sense Hat](/docs/software/firmware/fw_sensehat)).
Other modules are hosted on the internal panels (the [IO Exp](/docs/software/firmware/fw_ioexp)
and the Relays modules). Then, also the two gas sensors are placed on their own supports.

Other devices can be integrated using available USB ports or wireless using the
WiFi / Bluetooth connections (see [Victron BlueSolar and SmartSolar](/docs/software/firmware/fw_victron)).
