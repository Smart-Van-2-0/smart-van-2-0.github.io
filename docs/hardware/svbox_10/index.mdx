This model of the Smart Van Box is designed **to be used daily within your own
vehicles**.

This model can provide mobile internet connectivity through the 4G module
environmental monitoring with sensors, and the ability to connect up to 4 camper's
services with as many physical buttons.<br/>
Furthermore, this prototype is equipped with a GNSS module and a buffer battery
for IoT components. This way, your van will stay connected even when the vehicle
batteries are completely discharged or not plugged.

## Build your Smart Van Box

Explore the documentation of this prototype to get an idea of how to adapt it to
your needs. We recommend looking at the list of [required materials](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/resources#hardware-requirements)
and [case 3D models](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/resources#cases) to
understand which devices need to be included in this prototype and where you can
position them.

1. <h3>Prepare all the necessary materials</h3>
  Check the [Hardware Requirements](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/resources#hardware-requirements)
  and ensure you have everything needed to start.

2. <h3>Assemble your own Smart Van Box</h3>
  Build your device following the [assembly guides](/docs/hardware/svbox_10/guides#assembly).

3. <h3>Load the JOD Smart Van image and power everything on</h3>
  Flash the [JOD Smart Van](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van) image
  onto the SD card to be inserted into the 4Raspberry Pi. After that,
  insert it into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.


## Model's resources

The SVBox IoT's an IoT device based on Raspberry Pi that, with [JOD Smart Van](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van),
enables monitoring and controlling all services/systems connected to the Raspberry Pi
and, consequently, the Smart Van Box.

Within this device, various sensors are integrated, such as environmental
sensors, gas detection sensors, but also GPS and GSM modules. Additionally, the
block houses a buffer battery (UPS) that provides power to the IoT component
even when the service battery is disconnected or depleted.

The IoT block use a ribbon cable to connect the Raspberry Pi to all devices
with a 40-PIN header like the [Sense Hat](/docs/software/firmware/fw_sensehat),
the [SIM7600](/docs/software/firmware/fw_sim7600) and also a small custom
PCB board. This custom board houses the ports to connect the other devices in
the IoT block to the ribbon cable and thus to the Raspberry Pi.
