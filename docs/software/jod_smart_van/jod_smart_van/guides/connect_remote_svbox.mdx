## Connect to remote SmartVanBox

Each SmartVanBox provides privileged access for maintenance. Through this access,
you can read files (e.g., log files) and execute commands (updates,
configuration changes, etc.). There are two ways to obtain this privileged
access: via [SSH](#ssh-connection) or a [serial cable](#serial-connection).

In the first case, the connection is made through an IP network (e.g., WiFi),
which is the most common method. In the second case, a Serial-to-TTL cable is
used, which is very useful when the SmartVanBox has connectivity or network issues.


### SSH Connection

Depending on the settings configured on the SD card, your Raspberry Pi should be
connected to your chosen WiFi network. Ensure that your workstation is also
connected to the same network.

You can use an SSH client to access the Raspberry Pi's shell (command line) from
your workstation. This shell will allow you to install and configure the
JOD SmartVan Distribution.

- **From Windows**: Use PuTTY as the SSH client.
- **From Linux and macOS**: Use the built-in `ssh` utility in the terminal.

During the SSH connection, you'll be prompted for a username and password. Use
the credentials set during the SD card configuration (suggested: `svbox`/`smartvan`).
Once connected, you will be in the `/home/svbox` directory, ready to begin the
JOD SmartVan Distribution installation.

#### From Ubuntu

To SSH into a Raspberry Pi from a Linux device:
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open a terminal window.
2. Enter: `ssh [username]@[hostname].local` or `ssh [username]@[IP address]`,
  replacing `[username]` and `[hostname]` or `[IP address]` with your Raspberry
  Pi's details.

#### From Mac

To SSH into your Raspberry Pi from macOS:
1. Navigate to `Applications > Utilities`.
2. Open the terminal, and enter either `ssh [username]@[hostname].local` or
  `ssh [username]@[IP address]`. Replace `[username]` and `[hostname]` or
  `[IP address]` with your Raspberry Pi's details.

#### From Windows: PuTTY

To SSH into your Raspberry Pi from PuTTY:
1. Open PuTTY.
2. Under `Host Name (or IP address)`, enter your Raspberry Piâ€™s IP address or
  hostname.
3. Ensure that `Port` is set to 22.
4. Under `Connection type`, select `SSH`.
5. Select `Open`, then enter your username and password.

#### From Windows: PowerShell

To SSH into your Raspberry Pi using PowerShell:
1. Open PowerShell (press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, or search for PowerShell).
2. Enter the command: `ssh [username]@[hostname].local` or
  `ssh [username]@[IP address]`, replacing `[username]` and `[hostname]` or
  `[IP address]` with your Raspberry Pi's details.


### Serial Connection

The Serial-to-TTL cable is a very useful tool for debugging and maintenance
purposes. It allows you to access the Raspberry Pi's shell
(command line) directly from your workstation, even when the Raspberry Pi is not
connected to a network.

To establish a serial connection, you need a Serial-to-TTL cable and a terminal
emulator. The most common terminal emulators are PuTTY (Windows) and Minicom
(Linux).

#### PuTTY (Windows)

1. Open PuTTY.
2. Under `Connection type`, select `Serial`.
3. Set the `Serial line` to the COM port where the cable is connected.
4. Set the `Speed` to `115200`.
5. Select `Open`.

#### Minicom (Linux)

1. Install Minicom:
   ```shell
   $ sudo apt-get install minicom
   ```
2. Configure Minicom:
   ```shell
    $ sudo minicom -s
    ```
3. Select `Serial port setup`.
4. Set the `Serial Device` to the port where the cable is connected (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`).
5. Set the `Bps/Par/Bits` to `115200 8N1`.
6. Save the configuration and exit.
7. Start Minicom:
   ```shell
   $ sudo minicom
   ```
8. Press `Enter` to access the Raspberry Pi's shell.
