## Manage the SmartVanBox Firmwares

The SmartVanBox is a modular system that can be customized to fit different hardware
configurations. This flexibility is achieved through the use of firmwares, which are
software components responsible for managing specific hardware devices or functionalities.

The link between the SmartVanBox structure and the firmwares is defined in the
`structure.jod` file, which specifies the hierarchy of pillars and the corresponding
firmwares that provide the functionality for each pillar.
In this guide, we'll cover how to manage the firmwares installed on the SmartVanBox.
To know more about the SmartVanBox structure, check the [Customize SmartVanBox's structure](customize_svbox_structure)
guide.


All firmwares, for a JOD SmartVan Distribution, are located in the `$JOD_SV_DIST/deps`
folder. Firmware, if needed can be executed on JOD startup and stopped on JOD shutdown.
This can be done by updating the `$JOD_SV_DIST/scripts/pre-startup.sh` and
`$JOD_SV_DIST/scripts/post-shutdown.sh` scripts.

### Add/Update a new firmware

To add a new firmware you can follow these steps:

1. Stop the JOD SmartVan Distribution service.
   ```
   cd $JOD_SV_DIST
   bash stop.sh         // if the JOD SV Dist has been executed as a background process
   bash uninstall.sh    // if the JOD SV Dist has been installed as a daemon
    ```
1. Copy the new firmware's dir into the `$JOD_SV_DIST/deps` folder.
1. [Update the `structure.jod`](customize_svbox_structure) file to include the new firmware.
1. Update the `$JOD_SV_DIST/scripts/pre-startup.sh` script to run the firmware on JOD startup.
1. Update the `$JOD_SV_DIST/scripts/post-shutdown.sh` script to stop the firmware on JOD shutdown.
1. Start the JOD SmartVan Distribution service.
   ```
   cd $JOD_SV_DIST
   bash start.sh        // if the JOD SV Dist has been executed as a background process
   bash install.sh      // if the JOD SV Dist has been installed as a daemon
    ```
