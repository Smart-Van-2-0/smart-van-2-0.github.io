## Configure JOD SmartVan Distribution

To alter the JOD Distribution behavior, you can edit
the `$JOD_SV_DIST/configs/jod_configs.sh` file. This file contains the following
variables:

| Variable      | Default                    | Description                                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SIMULATE`    | `false`                    | Enable the firmware simulation option for all firmwares that supports it     |
| `VENV`        | `false`                    | If true, execute all python firmware in their own virtual environment        |
| `INLINE_LOGS` | `false`                    | If true, then it print all logging messages from firmwares                   |
| `JOD_YML`     | `$JOD_DIR/configs/jod.yml` | Absolute or $JOD_DIR relative file path for JOD config file                  |
| `JAVA_HOME`   | `null`                     | Absolute path to Java home folder (ex: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/)  |

**Simulate firmware:**

If `SIMULATE` is set to `true`, then all firmwares that supports the simulation
option will be executed in simulation mode. This means that the firmware will
not try to connect to the real device but it will simulate the device behavior
using a random value generator.

**Virtual environment:**

If `VENV` is set to `true`, then all python firmwares will be executed in their
own virtual environment. This means that the firmware will be executed in a
separate python environment with its own dependencies. This is useful to avoid
dependencies conflicts between firmwares.

To be able to use this feature, the `python3-venv` package must be installed on
the system. Then, for each firmware, generate his own venv folder using the
`python3 -m venv <firmware_folder>/venv` command. It requires to be executed
only once for each firmware and an internet connection is required.

**Inline logs:**

If `INLINE_LOGS` is set to `true`, then all logging messages from firmwares will
be printed on the console when the JOD Smart Van is executed in foreground mode.
This is useful to debug the firmware behavior.

Otherwise, you can find a log file for each firmware into the `logs` folder.
