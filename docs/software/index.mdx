After the hardware, the second component that constitutes the Smart Van solution
is the software. Like every IoT solution, Smart Van also has software for the
object, the JOD Smart Van known as the object's agent; and then, the user's
software, namely the mobile app.

The **user only needs to install the [SV Mobile App](#sv-mobile-app)** on their phone, after which
they can connect to the Smart Van Box and enjoy all the provided functionalities.<br/>
On the other hand, **when creating your own Smart Van Box**, at a certain point, you
need to **install the object's agent [JOD Smart Van](#jod-smart-van)** directly on your hardware. Fortunately,
JOD Smart Van is distributed not only including the JOD agent (the component
that manages IoT functionalities) but also the individual firmwares that
interact directly with the hardware. This makes the installation of
hardware-specific software not only straightforward but also highly flexible
and easy to customize to your needs.

If you want to customize or modify the mobile app or firmware, the SmartVan
project makes **all the source
code [repositories available](https://github.com/orgs/Smart-Van-2-0/repositories)
**. Please post your changes to help the community. Read more on the <MapCollaborate />
page.


## SV Mobile App

The Mobile App to control your Smart Van Box for **[Android](software/sv_mobile_app/android)**
and **[iOS](/docs/software/sv_mobile_app/ios)**.

Most people know how to **install a smartphone app** from the official stores.
Just search for <code>SmartVan</code> in the most popular app stores and install
the one you find (**NB!** at the moment, no app has been published yet, so you
won't find the right one in the results).

If you want to install a specific version or the latest available, you can
download the installation file from [the download page](/docs/software/sv_mobile_app/downloads) for
your smartphone and proceed with the 'install from file' procedure for your
smartphone.


## JOD Smart Van

The object's agent as a installable distribution **[JOD Smart Van](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van)** or
the **[SmartVan JOD Image](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/jod_smart_van_image)** an
entire OS's image ready to be flashed.

The software to be loaded on the devices is called firmware. For each device
assembled according to the tutorials in the Hardware section, you must **load
the corresponding firmware**.

All the software to be installed on the object is provided and documented within
these pages. Starting with the main software, the object agent JOD Smart Van,
which manages the communication and other IoT aspects. Included in the object's
agent distribution are the actual firmwares, the programs that communicate
directly with the hardware. Typically, to have a fully operational Smart Van
Box, it is sufficient to install and configure only the object agent that you
can find into the [Object Distribution Downloads](/docs/software/jod_smart_van/downloads) page.
