## Develop the SmartVan Mobile App

The mobile application is the main interface for the user to interact with the
Smart Van system. It is available for both Android and iOS operating systems.

The application must **implements all Smart Van <MapFeatures />**, and,
depending on the connected Smart Van Box, it must enable/disable the available
features based on the Smart Van <MapSpecs /> provided by the Smart Van Box.

In order to contribute to the mobile application, you must have a basic
knowledge of the Android or iOS development environment. Depending on the OS
you want to contribute to, you must set up the respective development
environment.<br/>
Then you can test your application connecting a real Smart Van Box or simulating
it directly on your computer.

### Android

The Android application is developed in Java and uses the Android Studio IDE.
Follow these simple steps to get your development environment up and running:

1. **Install Android Studio:**<br/>
  Download and install Android Studio, the official IDE for Android
  development, from the official website.
  Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. **Open Android Studio and Configure SDK:**
  Launch Android Studio after installation. If prompted, update the IDE to the
  latest version.<br/>
  Navigate to "Preferences" (on macOS) or "Settings" (on Windows/Linux).  Select
  "Appearance & Behavior" -> "System Settings" -> "Android SDK.". Install the
  necessary SDK Platforms and SDK Tools. Ensure you have at least one Android
  version installed.
3. **Set Up a Smartphone Emulator or Connect a Physical Device:**<br/>
  Create a virtual device using the AVD Manager in Android Studio or connect
  your Android device to your computer.
  For the emulator, follow the prompts to set up a virtual device with the
  desired specifications.
4. **Clone the Smart Van App Repository:**<br/>
  Clone the [SV Mobile App Android](https://github.com/Smart-Van-2-0/com.robypomper.smartvan.app.android)
  repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file.
5. **Open the Project in Android Studio:**<br/>
  In Android Studio, select "Open an existing Android Studio project."
  Navigate to the location where you cloned the Smart Van app repository and
  open it.
6. **Sync and Build:**<br/>
  Android Studio may prompt you to sync the project with Gradle. Allow it to do
  so. Build the project by clicking the "Build" button or selecting "Build" -> "
  Make Project" from the menu.
7. **Run the App:**<br/>
  Choose your emulator or connected device from the list.
  Click the "Run" button or select "Run" -> "Run 'app'" to deploy the Smart Van
  app.

If you don't have a SmartVanBox available, you can always [simulate one from your workstation](simulate_svbox_on_dev_machine).
