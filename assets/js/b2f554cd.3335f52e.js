It is a\\ncompact, efficient, and powerful device that can seamlessly integrate with your\\nexisting vehicle systems.\\n\\n## Assembly and Configuration\\n\\nWe have made the assembly process as simple and intuitive as possible. The SVBox\\nIoT 1.0 uses HAT modules, which are designed to be stacked one on top of the other,\\nmuch like LEGO bricks. This design allows for easy assembly and disassembly,\\nproviding flexibility and convenience.\\n\\nIn addition to the main HAT modules, there are three other boards (2x gas sensors\\n+ relays) that need to be connected via cables to the main block of the device,\\nwhich also houses the Raspberry Pi. Once you have received all the components,\\nyou can proceed with the assembly.\\n\\n## Specifications and Features\\n\\nThe SVBox IoT 1.0 comes with a host of features and specifications. It can provide\\nGNSS info from various systems (GPS/Beidou/GLONASS/GALILEO/QZSS), detect movement,\\norientation, and the magnetic field, provide environment-related data, and much more.\\n\\nWith the AW9523B, the IO Expansion board can listen up to 16 buttons (8 by default)\\nand control up to 16 relays (8 by default). Victron\'s SmartSolar/BlueSolar series\\ndevices can provide info about the service\'s battery status, solar panel charge,\\nand load consumption.\\n\\nThe UPS Pack with its own battery for the IoT block provides info about the\\nbattery status. The SIM7600 module can provide mobile connectivity and its\\nstatus. You can use the onboard RPi WiFi to provide a local WiFi network and\\nkeep track of the RPi load status."},{"id":"/2023/12/05/released-jod-smart-van","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/12/05/released-jod-smart-van","editUrl":"https://github.com/smart-van-2-0/smart-van-2-0.github.io/edit/main/blog/2023-12-05-released-jod-smart-van.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-05-released-jod-smart-van.mdx","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Released JOD Smart Van v.1.0.0","description":"We are delighted to announce the release of JOD Smart Van version 1.0.0,","date":"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"jod_smart_van","permalink":"/blog/tags/jod-smart-van"}],"readingTime":0.985,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Pompermaier","title":"Senior Software Architect","url":"https://www.robypomper.org","imageURL":"https://github.com/robypomper.png","key":"robypomper"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"\ud83d\ude80 Released JOD Smart Van v.1.0.0","authors":"robypomper","tags":["release","jod_smart_van"]},"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83d\ude80 Introducing the New SVBox IoT 1.0","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/06/published-new-svbox-iot-10"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83c\udf10 Website Update Announcement - Version 1.1.0","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/28/website-update"}},"content":"We are delighted to announce the release of JOD Smart Van version 1.0.0,\\nbringing a host of new features, improvements, and firmware updates.
